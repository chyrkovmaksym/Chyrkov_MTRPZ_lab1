# Quadratic Equation Solver
Lab 1, Methodologies and technologies of software development

## Short description:
This simple app solves quadratic equations in two modes:
- Interactive mode (coefficients can be entered in runtime with console)
- File mode (coefficients are previously specified in the file)

## Instructions for Lab1:
1) Firstly, ensure that you have .NET 6 and Visual Studio installed on your computer. (These instructions assume that you are using the Windows operating system.)

2) Open the "Lab1.sln" file in Visual Studio.

3) Add the "file.txt" file by navigating to the following path: "/Chyrkov_MTRPZ_lab1/Lab1/bin/Debug/net6.0/file.txt". This is required for the non-interactive mode of the program.

4) Save the changes to the solution.

These steps will ensure that the program runs smoothly in both non-interactive and interactive modes. Please note that the coefficients should be listed in a single line separated by spaces in the "file.txt" file.

Example:
```
1 4 4
```
